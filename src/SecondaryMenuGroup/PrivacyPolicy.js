                <h2>Retention of Your Personal Data</h2>
                <p>The Company will retain Your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out
                    in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use Your Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply

                    applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.</p>
                <p>The Company will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is generally
                    retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or

                    other places where the parties involved in the processing are located. It means that this
                    information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of Your state,
                    province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than
                    those from Your jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by Your submission of such information represents Your
                    agreement to that transfer.</p>
                <p>The Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Your data is treated securely and
                    in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of Your Personal Data will take place to an
                    organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of Your
                    data and other personal information.</p>
                <h2>Delete Your Personal Data</h2>

                    collected about You.</p>
                <p>Our Service may give You the ability to delete certain information about You from within the

                <p>Please note, however, that We may need to retain certain information when we have a legal obligation
                    or lawful basis to do so.</p>
                <h2>Disclosure of Your Personal Data</h2>
                <h3>Business Transactions</h3>
                <p>If the Company is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, Your Personal Data may be
                    transferred. We will provide notice before Your Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject to
                    a different Privacy Policy.</p>
                <h3>Law enforcement</h3>
                <p>Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to disclose Your Personal Data if required
                    to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or a government
                    agency).</p>
                <h3>Other legal requirements</h3>
                <p>The Company may disclose Your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such action is necessary
                    to:</p>

                <h2>Security of Your Personal Data</h2>
                <p>The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us, but remember that no method of transmission
                    over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While We strive to use
                    commercially acceptable means to protect Your Personal Data, We cannot guarantee its absolute
                    security.</p>
                <h1>Children's Privacy</h1>

                    are aware that Your child has provided Us with Personal Data, please contact Us. If We become aware
                    that We have collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of
                    parental consent, We take steps to remove that information from Our servers.</p>
                <p>If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information and Your country
                    requires consent from a parent, We may require Your parent's consent before We collect and use that
                    information.</p>
